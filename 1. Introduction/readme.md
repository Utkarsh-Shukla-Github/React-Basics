### Reusable Code

-   Same Component in React can also be used for other framework like Angular & Vue by passing right data.

### React is declarative 

-   Tell react **What you want** & react will build the **actual UI**.
-   React will handle efficively updating & rendering of the Component.
-   **DOM** updates are handle gracefully in react.

### More on Why React?

-   Seamlessly integrate react into any of your application.
-   Portion of your page or a complete page or even an entire application itself.
-   **React Native** for Mobile application.

### Prequisite

-   **HTML, CSS, Javascript**.
-   **ES6** 
-   **Javascript** - *this* keyword , *filter*, *map* & *reduce*.
-   **ES6** - *let* & *const*, *arrow functions*, *template literals*,*default parameter*, *object literals*, *spread operator*, & *destructuring assignment*.
